Recreation of the classic game Mastermind.

A user navigates through text-based menus to read instructions, play, and set a difficulty. After setting a difficulty,
the user attempts to guess the pattern that is set randomly by the computer. Feedback is given after each guess.

Upon successfully guessing the pattern, the user is presented with their final time and number of guesses taken.
